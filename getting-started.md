# 🚀 Getting Started with Sera JS

To quickly set up a new project using the official Sera JS template, follow
these steps:

## 1. Clone the Template

Use `degit` to scaffold your project from the Sera JS template:

```bash
npx degit sera-js/template my-app
cd my-app
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Start Development Server

Once installed, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your Sera JS app should now be running locally. Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

to see it in action!

> ⚠️ **Note:** Sera JS currently only supports **npm** for package management.
